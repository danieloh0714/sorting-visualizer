# Sorting Visualizer
I created a sorting visualizer that visualizes five common sorting algorithms: bubble, selection, insertion, merge, and quick.

## 
Click "New Array" to generate a new array.  
"Toggle Size" toggles the size of the array--either 20 bars or 120 bars. The sorting speeds will adjust accordingly for visual purposes.
Choose a sorting algorithm to visualize.  
Click sort and enjoy!!!
